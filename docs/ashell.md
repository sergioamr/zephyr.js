'A Shell' Command line interface to run JavaScript on demand
============================================================

* [Introduction](#introduction)
* [Compilation](#compilation)
* [Commands](#commands)

Introduction
------------
This shell focus is on creating an interface to be able to run commands and
arbitrary JavaScript directly from the USB port of a Zephyr enabled device.

Although the shell would look like a common Unix Bash, it is heavily limited
due the constraints of the micro-controller.

Compilation
------------

This command will enable the shell compilation:
`make DEV=ashell`

Dev mode will append all the functionality from ZJS, so it might not fit in ROM.

Connect
-------

Use this command to connect to ashell from a terminal

```bash
$ screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200
```

Note: It will take about 30 seconds for it to be up and running after you boot.
Until then you will see screen terminate immediately.  If you see this, just
try again in a few seconds.

Commands
--------

To get a full list of commands, run the help command.

```
acm> help
'A Shell' bash

Commands list:
    help This help
    eval Evaluate JavaScript in real-time
   clear Clear the terminal screen
    load [FILE] Saves the input text into a file
     run [FILE] Runs the JavaScript program in the file
    stop Stops current JavaScript execution
      ls [FILE] List directory contents or file stat
     cat [FILE] Print the file contents on the stdout
      du [FILE] Estimate file space usage
      rm [FILE] Remove file or directory
      mv [SOURCE] [DEST] Move a file to destination
     set Sets the input mode for 'load' accept data
        transfer raw
        transfer ihex
  reboot Reboots the device
```

### Eval

`eval`

This command will set the device in a continuous evaluation mode.
The shell prompt will change to 'js>'

```
acm> eval

Ready to evaluate JavaScript.
        Ctrl+X or Ctrl+C to return to shell.
js>
```

From that point on it will evaluate each line of JavaScript independently
so you can run commands, create functions (as far as they fit in one line)
and get results.

### cat

`cat <filename>`

Output the text from file to the terminal

### run

`run <filename>`

The program will be loaded from disk into memory, parsed
and run.

In case of an error while parsing it will stop parsing and output
"Failed parsing JS"

### ls

`ls`

List contents of current root folder

### rm

`rm <filename>`

Remove file

### Load

`load <filename>`

Sets the device ready to get raw or ihex text input.
The text will be recorded in the FAT File system.

Example of raw text input
```
acm> load test.js

Saving to 'test.js'
Ready for JavaScript.
        Ctrl+Z to finish transfer.
        Ctrl+X or Ctrl+C to cancel.
RAW>
```

### Data transfer

Set the mode to accept data when the 'load' transmission starts

1. Raw data
Will be plain text that contains the code. No CRC or error checking.
After the transmission is finished you can parse or run the code.

2. Intel Hex
Basic CRC, hexadecimal data with data sections and regions.
It might be that the code is divided in sections and you will only update a section of the memory.
This will be used for the future integration to support JS Snapshots.

```
set transfer ihex
set transfer raw
```

## Data transaction example using IHEX

The motivation of the IHEX use is to be able to upload binary or text
files and have some basic support for CRC.

```
acm> set transfer ihex
HEX> load
```
<Send ihex data here>
Example:
```
:2000000066756E6374696F6E2074657374696E67286E756D62657229207B0A097265747514
:20002000726E206E756D6265722A323B0A7D3B0A7072696E742822486920776F726C642044
:0F004000222B74657374696E6728313829293B48
:00000001FF
```
Move the temporary file to a destination file
```
HEX> mv temp.dat test.js
HEX> run test.js
```

Problems and known issues
========================

ZJS will only execute timeouts or events on the first run. Sometimes there is
a duplicated character written to the ACM.
